How much variable is my event log?

This project consists of 3 functions written in python to measure variability of a log.

Three different metrics are considered in each function:

1. Counting the number of variants
2. Average of the Minimum Edit Distance of all variants
3. Trace Entropy using  using exact trace frequency as the probabilities.


A report is also included in this repo, which describes the defined metrics in the python functions,
the overall structure of the code and 
test results using Test Logs from Moodle Page, and finally testing on the BPI Challenge 2011 log
